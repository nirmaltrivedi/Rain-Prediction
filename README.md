This data science project is made to predict if rain is going to happen tomorrow or not. This is a classification project made using various python libraries and machine learning models.

We have used python and its libraries to make this code run. During the model building, we did multiple things such as data cleaning, visualization, outlier detection by IQR method and quantile method, and feature engineering. For classification method we have used the random forest classifier model and have obtained an accuracy of 85%. We also implemented other classifiers such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression and Naive bayes. Here we have used the data of rain dataset from Kaggle. The following are the tools and libraries we used to build this model:

Python language
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook
